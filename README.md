## 🚀 Running Locally

1. ### Installation of main cypress-realworld-app

To clone the repo to your local system and install dependencies, execute the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bovsunivskyios-eng/realworld-playwright-tests.git
cd realworld-playwright-tests
yarn
```

#### Mac users with M-series chips will need to prepend `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`.

```shell
PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true yarn install
```

### Run the main app (if you have some problems with running main app on http://localhost:3000, please see full original README.md.bak)

```shell
yarn dev 
```

2. Install root project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

3. Navigate to the Playwright project: 
    ```bash
    cd playwright
    ```

4. Install Playwright dependencies and required browsers:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   npm run install-browsers
   npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
   ```

5. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

> Playwright automatically starts n`npm run dev` from the root and tests the UI at `http://localhost:3000` if you don't start main app from root folder.
